# Basic exploration game
This is one of the first games I've developed. The idea was an infinite world with procedural terrain, structures, and caves that the player could explore. 

# World
The terrain in the world is completely procedurally generated. With the help of multithreading for generation, the player can see about 4km in every direction. 

## Biomes
The game has three separate biomes, with different terrain and vegetation generation.

**Desert**

Dune-like terrain and sparse, dead vegetation

**Forest**

Hilly terrain with a wide range of vegetation

**Mountains**

Mountainous terrain with a colder climate

## Structures
Various types of structures are generated throughout the world: three village types, dungeons, and cave systems. Similar to the terrain, they are all fully procedurally generated, down to the various detail objects like candles and cups placed on shelves.

### Villages

The basic villages are generated as simple houses and have two variants. Villagers spawn and roam around offering quests to the player

The third village type are ruins of a town with skeletons that will attack the player if they venture too close

### Dungeons

The dungeons spawn as large towers with many floors that the player needs to make their way through. Inside, they are able to find chests and will eventually be able to fight enemies which get harder with each level they ascend.

### Caves
The player is able to find cave entrances scattered throughout the world. Using the elevator inside, they can descend into large cave systems filled with various ores to be mined

With the help of a specific vein type and a miner, they can also automate the harvesting of ores
